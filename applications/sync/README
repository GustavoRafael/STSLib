Compute the synchronization of a given list of DES files.

Usage: SYNC -o output_DES_file -p plant_DES_files
Wildcards like * and ? can be used for file names, e.g., m* includes all DES files starting with m.
All items must be seperated by whitespace.

I cannot use 'sync' as the application's name because it is a reserved keyword in C++.
