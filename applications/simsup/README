The SIMSUP (simplified supervisor) is a procedure that computes a simplifed
supervisor from a given control problem. It exploits the Binary Decision
Diagrams (BDD).

Make sure that you have installed both BuDDy and STSLib first. To compile it, just type
	make

The command-line usage is given by
	simsup -o output_DES_file -p plant_DES_files -s spec_DES_files
where
	1) output_DES_file holds the resulting simplifed supervisor
	2) plant_DES_files are a list of plant DES components
	3) spec_DES_files are a list of specification DES components
All DES files in 2) and 3) are created by TCT. 

VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE: 
	All SPEC components must have the SAME alphabet. 
	This can be achieved in TCT by applying the procedure SELFLOOP 
	to each spec component.

Semantically, the overall plant DES model is given by
	P := SYNC(P1,P2,...Pn),
where P1,P2,...Pn are the plant DES components. Notice tha the overall
specification DES is given by
	E := MEET(E1,E2,...En),
where E1,E2,...En are the spec components. The difference between P and E
is from the fact that all E1,E2,...En must have the same alphabet.

SIMSUP is equivalent to the composition of the following TCT procedures:
	1) P := SYNC(P1,P2,...Pn), E := MEET(E1,E2,...En),
	2) SUP := SUPCON(P,E)
	3) DAT := CONDAT(P,SUP)
	4) SIM := SUPREDUCE(P,SUP,DAT)
