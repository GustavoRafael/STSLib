STSLib - State Tree Structure Library

What you need to build STSLib
---------------------------------------
* Unix-like Operating Systems
* gcc/g++ with a version above 4.2.1
* Make sure that you have the [BuDDy BDD package] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/buddy/) installed first.

* Install

* * **`sudo make`**: simply type `make` to build all the components. You may have to edit the makefile to update the installation path to fit your need. Here I am using the default path in OS X.

I will add more complex examples later.

This is released under MIT. Basically you do whatever you want with the code. But if you screw up, do not come to blame me. :-)
